Build a simple chatbot that responds to user inputs based on
predefined rules. Use if-else statements or pattern matching
techniques to identify user queries and provide appropriate
responses. This will give you a basic understanding of natural

language processing and conversation flow.
def greet(name):
  """Greets the user by name."""
  return f"Hi {name}, how can I help you today?"

def answer_question(question):
  """Provides a response to the user's question based on predefined rules."""
  if "weather" in question:
    return "I can't provide weather information yet, but I'm still learning!"
  elif "time" in question:
    from datetime import datetime
    now = datetime.now().strftime("%H:%M:%S")
    return f"The current time is {now}."
  elif "your name" in question:
    return "I'm Bard, a large language model from Google AI."
  else:
    return "I don't understand, but I'm always learning. Can you rephrase your question?"

def main():
  """Maintains the conversation flow with the user."""
  name = input("What's your name? ")
  print(greet(name))

  while True:
    user_input = input("> ").lower()
    if user_input == "bye":
      break
    else:
      print(answer_question(user_input))

if __name__ == "__main__":
  main()
